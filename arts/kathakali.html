    <p>‘Kathakali’, an important genre in the Indian classical dance form, is associated with storytelling form of 
        this art. It is the dance drama from the south Indian state of Kerala. Similar to other Indian classical
        dance arts, the story in ‘Kathakali’ is also communicated to audience through excellent footwork and impressive
         gestures of face and hands complimented with music and vocal performance. However it can be distinguished from
          the others through the intricate and vivid make-up, unique face masks and costumes worn by dancers as also 
          from their style and movements that reflect the age-old martial arts and athletic conventions prevalent in 
          Kerala and surrounding regions. Traditionally performed by male dancers, it developed in courts and theatres
           of Hindu regions contrary to other Indian classical dances which predominantly developed in Hindu temples and
            monastic schools. Although not clearly traceable, this classical dance form is considered to have originated 
            from temple and folk arts that trace back to 1st millennium CE or before</p>
            <br>
            <h3>History & Evolution </h3>
            <p>Author Phillip Zarrilli mentions that the basic components and distinct features of this form of 
                classical dance can be traced back to ancient Sanskrit Hindu text called ‘Natya Shastra’, a text on
                 the performing arts written by the sage Bharata Muni, an Indian theatrologist and musicologist.
                  Although the full version of the text is conjectured to be completed between 200 BCE to 200 CE,
                   such time span also hover around 500 BCE to 500 CE. Various chapters of this text consist of thousands 
                   of verses. Dance is categorised in two specific forms in ‘Natya Shastra’ - ‘nrita’ and nritya’. While the
                    former is pure dance that concentrates on hand movements and gestures, the latter is solo expressive dance
                     that showcases brilliance of expressions. Natalia Lidova, a Russian scholar mentions that the text throws
                      light upon different theories of Indian classical dances that includes theories of Tandava dance, standing
                       postures, basic steps, bhava, rasa, methods of acting and gestures. Traditionally the name of this dance 
                       form was deduced by joining two words, ‘Katha’ and ‘Kali’ where ‘Katha’ in Sanskrit means a traditional 
                       tale or story and ‘Kali’ derived from ‘Kala’ refers to art and performance.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p>Kathakali is a classical dance form of Kerala, demanding long years of training. Believed to have
              evolved from Ramanattam, another classical art form composed by Kottarakkara Thampuran, Kathakali
               incorporates the techniques of some of the major ritual art forms of Kerala.

              The characters of Kathakali do not speak and the story is presented through songs from the background.
               This makes Kathakali music a very important component of this art form. The text of Kathakali songs 
               is known as Attakkatha. Chenda, Maddalam, Chengila and Elaththalam are the instruments used with 
               Kathakali music.
              
              Like most other classical dance forms of India, Kathakali is also based on Natya Shastra, the ancient
               treatise on dance, written by Sage Bharata. However, Kathakali relies on Hasthalakshana Deepika, 
               another classical text for its hand gestures.</p>
