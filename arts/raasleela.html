<p>Raas Leela is an Indian folk dance emanating in the holy cities of Mathura and Vrindavan. It can be traced back to the Hindu sacred writings like the ‘Bhagavata Purana’. The raas leela has been immortalized by folklore where Lord Krishna dances with his love Radha and the gopis. Legend has it that children would dance and play along the banks of Yamuna, but slowly they grew bored of it and stopped one day. Lord Krishna was upset by this change as he was very fond of watching them, so he decided to play music by his flute. Such mesmerizing was his music that the young people joined him and started dancing around him. Radha and Krishna also danced with them and it continued for the night. Since then, it was known as Raas Leela and is immensely popular till this day. </p>
