      <p>Dance is that form of art that lets your soul sparkle through the steps that reveal spiritual themes of
         life and essence of scriptures. Hundreds of dance forms exist in the world, but only a few can fend for 
         peace of mind and soul. One such form is Kathak, it is an Indian classical dance form that expresses a 
         story through foot movements and facial expressions.

        Their origin traces back to the bards of ancient north Indians who were known as ‘Kathakars’ or storytellers.
         The word ‘Kathak’ was found in the Vedic term ‘Katha’ which means ‘Story’. Kathak dancers are connected by 
         bells and they strung tight together and follow a progression in tempo from slow to fast, ending with a dramatic
          climax.
        
        There are several forms that fall under Kathak, a short dance composition is known as ‘Tukra’ while a longer one
         is known as ‘Atoda’. There are also compositions that only consists of foot movements.</p>

        <p>It was being said that wandering Kathakars communicated stories of ancient mythologies and epics through 
            dance. The facial expressions are the key to communicate a whole story. Kathak evolved from being particularly 
            focussing towards childhood and stories of the Hindu god Krishna. Kathak encompasses both Hindu and Muslim 
            ‘Gharanas’ and cultural attributes. Several Kathak performances comprise of Urdu ghazals and preferably use 
            instruments that were consumed during Muslim rule.

            Kathak is formed in three different forms called ‘Gharanas’ that are named after the cities from where the
             dance form evolved that was Jaipur, Banaras, Lucknow. It has been observed that the Jaipur Gharana mostly 
             focusses on foot movements while the Banaras and Lucknow Gharanas focus more on facial expressions.</p>
